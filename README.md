# *Project Name*- NETFLIX MOVIES AND TV SHOWS CLUSTERING

# *Problem statement*-
Netflix is a popular streaming platform that offers a vast collection of movies and TV shows to its users. With so many options available, it can be challenging for users to find content that aligns with their preferences. To address this issue, we aim to develop a recommendation system that suggests movies and TV shows to users based on their viewing history, ratings, and other attributes. The goal of this project is to design and implement a recommendation algorithm that can accurately predict the content preferences of users and provide personalized recommendations. The effectiveness of the recommendation system will be evaluated based on user engagement and satisfaction metrics. The results of this project can help Netflix to improve user retention and increase customer satisfaction.
